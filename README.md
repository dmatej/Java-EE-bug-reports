# Java EE bug reports

This project started 16. 1. 2018 and will be used to produce simple testcase for reporting bugs in another repositories. Maybe it could be used also for some "accpetance" tests later, but the problem will be maintenance.

The maintenance might be also a reason for splitting repository in many branches. 

This is my little experiment, so we shall see ...
